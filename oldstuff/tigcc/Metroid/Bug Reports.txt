Found a gigantic bug.  I believe in the readme you said that pressing f3 allows you 
to space jump, but in the 89 version it causes a gigantic freeze and crash so i had to 
manually reset the RAM (battery-style).
Nothing happened, it just froze and the 2nd+left+right+on combo wouldn't
respond either, and there was no address error bar or anything else at the
top.  It was quite strange.

Good stuff:
- key responce it good
- jumping is really good
- collision detection is quite nice

Needs improvement:
- gfx definitely needs to be improved a lot, but that's reall something for
later. gfx is good enough for testing. maps are also good enough for testing
despite a comment below regarding their suckiness.
- the diagonal shots in my opinion need to be improved. how about if user
presses [shift] or [alpha] shot would be fire diagonally w/t. that way one
could run and still be able to fire diagonally.
- diagonal shots fired downwards are almost impossible to see. maybe their speed
it a bit too fast?
- when your roll in a ball into a small space not high enough for you to stand
up, you can still stand but your head will be clipped thru a tile. you don't
get stuck but this may need to be fixed in future.
- i think jumping while in a ball should be also using the [<>] button and not
[2nd] for consistency reasons.
- firing a bullet while jumping seems awfully laggy. you probably may want to
adjust your firing/jumping routines to work better together.
- i'd also consider making bullets blink so that they're easier to see (kinda
like they did in Contra on old GameBoy to improve bullet visibility).

Bugs seen:
-none so far

Other than that, everything seems to work very nice. Never had any lockups or
resets, so everything seems pretty solid as of now.

If you go allt eh way to the bottom-left corner and
moroh and use bombs and move left, you will go into
the wall. You can also unmoroh there, and be inside
the wall (until you move out). You can not get there
when you are unmorphed...

The flyimng enemies have bad crash detection and it is
quite annoying when you are stuck on top of the
l;and-based enemies with nothing to do but wait until
the enemy moves out of your way and you can run away.
Shooting at an angle is cubersome and [UP] dos the
same thing when shooting as [F4]+[F5]. The two
different kinds of jumps should be integrated. I do
not see what benefit holding [2ND] ("charging") has.
Also, it is hard to climb using bombs when you are
morphed. You should move upward faster when morphed
and you should be able to move slightly left/right
when flying (jumping?) using bombs. That is all so
far... I'm looking forwart to a better release! Oh,
yes; there should be "super-bombs" that are limited
(powerups...?) and can destroy small sections of wall.

FINALLY got around to the game, TI-Connect was giving me problems.
Anyways, I patched the programs and it ran fine.  Obviously, I noticed
some of the little bugs like rolling into the wall and how an enemy can
get you stuck by getting hurt.  I also noticed how you don't actually
aim the gun in a direction, I just figured that was because of the early
version.  Overall, I was pleased, it really did feel like a metroid
game.

However, I found one little problem with the controls.  I would
personally rather have the sprint button close to the jump button so I
could make jumps easier.

The "jumping enemy" once jumped all the way to the
ceiling and OFF OF THE SCREEN when I did something...
exploded some bombs near it I think...

I just realized... if you shoot and then sprint in the same direction,
you will actually pass your shots...

Some things about the beta:
   1. Awesome graphics and smooth runtime so far.
   2. Does the series justice.  All the controls are perfect
   3. I did have trouble doing the bomb jump, though.  I did it once by chance then I couldn't find it again.
   4. Need some more levels.  That's probably the last thing though, but the levels so far are kinda plain as well.
   5. Enemy sprites are a bit unclear, that is to say, i can't really tell what they are
   6. Last but not least, I can't really see that the power-up shot works either.  Maybe it does, but it doesn't
look any different than the regular one on my version

There are several annoyances with the controls in metroid when playing on the 92+. I would strongly 
reccommend changing the controls on the 92+ to:

Jump: F1
Shoot\Charge: F2
Sprint: F3
Aim up: F5
Aim down:F6
Aim strait up: The hand thingy
Up Down left right: Control Pad
Change level: F4
Quit: ESC

This DOES NOT apply to the v200. I will examine the v200 later and see what controls would be best. 
Also, I do not notice any difference in speed when you press shift on the 89.

Very cool!  I patched it with ghostbuster and it works fine.  I was
surprised how much it actually felt like metroid.
Several notes:

1. Are you going to implement firing upwards or at angles?
2. Will bombs explode in the future?
3. Things seem a little unresponsive.
4. Would you like me to email you a ghostbuster-patched program if you
want to release a demo?  You should note to users that they would have
to run the metcode program.
