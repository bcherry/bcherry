Alien Invasion Source v1.5
===========================

This is the source to Alien Invasion v1.5
This source is mainly for people who want to learn how to program in C, or for people who want to make MODs for the game.

If you want to alter the game in any way and post it at ticalc.org, it MUST be under certain conditions.

1.  You must credit me as the primary author, and you as the 2nd author
2.  Before you post it, email me to confirm it.
3.  If you dont know how to program in C, and you still want your own MOD, email me about it and send me any pictures etc. and explain what you     want to change and i will do  it for you, and post it with you as the secondary author.

See Alien Invasion Directors Cut for an example of a MOD of this game.
I hope you enjoy my game, and expect many more good games to come :)
