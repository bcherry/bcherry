NAME
     wordfreq - binary tree word count utility

SYNOPSIS
     wordfreq [-D] [filename...]

DESCRIPTION
     The input is scanned for words.  At the end of all of the files,
     a frequency table is printed, sorted by word, showing each unique
     word found in the input along with the number of times it
     appears.  Words are converted to lower case.  A word is any
     sequence of alphanumeric characters.

OPTIONS
     Any word of the command line which begins with a minus sign is an
     option unless it consists of a minus sign by itself.  Options are
     scanned by getopt(3c).  The following options are supported:

     -D   At the end of execution, instead of printing the output in
          the normal manner, a debug dump of the entire binary tree is
          done in debug format showing the values in each node and all
          pointers in the nodes.

     --   Option scanning stops and all further words from the command
          line are operands.  See getopt(3c).

OPERANDS
     All operands are filenames.  Each file is read in sequence.  If
     no files are specified on the command line, stdin is read.  If
     any filename is specified as a single minus sign (`-'), stdin is
     read at that point.

EXIT STATUS
     0    All input files were read, output was generated, and no
          invalid options were found.
     1    An error occurred.
